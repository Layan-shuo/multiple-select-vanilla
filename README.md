# Multiple-Select-Vanilla

## Description
Multiple-Select-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [Multiple-Select (jQuery)](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select) original lib, it is based on the version `1.5.2`. The difference is that we dropped jQuery and rewrote necessary code in plain vanilla/pure JavaScript without any dependencies (zero dependency).

This lib allows you to select multiple elements with checkboxes :).
