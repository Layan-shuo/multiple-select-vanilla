## Official Release now available ðŸ“£
We now have a fully working and official release `0.1.0` including a [**Live demo**](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) for all available options/methods. The intention is to use this demo to add Cypress E2E tests.

## Description
Multiple-Select-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [Multiple-Select (jQuery)](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select) original lib, it is based on the latest version `1.5.2` from the original lib. The main difference is that we dropped jQuery and rewrote necessary code in plain vanilla/pure JavaScript without any dependencies (zero dependency). We will also add nice extra features pretty soon, for example auto-position (top/bottom & left/right) is planned.

This lib allows you to select multiple elements with checkboxes :).
