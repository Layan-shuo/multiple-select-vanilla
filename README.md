## Official Release is coming in the next few days ðŸ“£
Watch for an upcoming version in the coming days, the [live](https://ghiscoding.github.io/multiple-select-vanilla/) demo is already up and running though :)

## Description
Multiple-Select-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [Multiple-Select (jQuery)](https://github.com/wenzhixin/multiple-select) original lib, it is based on the version `1.5.2`. The difference is that we dropped jQuery and rewrote necessary code in plain vanilla/pure JavaScript without any dependencies (zero dependency).

This lib allows you to select multiple elements with checkboxes :).

To get started checkout examples and documentation at http://wenzhixin.net.cn/p/multiple-select

## Installation

```shell
npm install multiple-select-vanilla
```

## Changes from original
New Multiple-Select Options:
- dropped jQuery requirement and replaced necessary code with pure vanilla JS code.
